# The dcmqrdb program can use the vendor table to restrict move destination
# to hosts belonging to a vendor.
# Also, the dcmqrti and dcmqrdb programs use the name defined on the left hand side
# as the vendor name to display above images.

#       VendorName = SymbolicName
# The symbolic name should be defined in the HostTable.
