# The VendorTable is used by the dcmqrdb and dcmqrti applications.
# You can give a vendor name (r.h.s. entry below) to the dcmqrti
# program and it will talk to all hosts and AEs of the vendor.
# The dcmqrdb program can use the vendor table to restrict move destination
# to hosts belonging to a vendor.
# Also, the dcmqrti and dcmqrdb programs use the name defined on the left hand side
# as the vendor name to display above images.
#
# The format:
#       VendorName = SymbolicName
# The symbolic name should be defined in the HostTable.
