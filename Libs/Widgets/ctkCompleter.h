/// ctkCompleter is a bit hackish as it reimplements a methods (splitPath)
/// from QCompleter in a way that is not intended.
/// Disclaimer, it might not work in all contexts, but seems to work
/// fine with a QLineEdit.
/// e.g.:
/// QStringList model;
/// model << "toto tata tutu";
/// model << "tata toto tutu";
/// ctkCompleter completer(model);
/// completer.setModelFiltering(ctkCompleter::FilterWordStartsWith);
/// QLineEdit lineEdit;
/// lineEdit.setCompleter(&completer);
/// ...
/// If the user types "ta", both entries will show up in the completer
/// If the user types "ot", no entries will show up in the completer
/// however using \sa FilterContains would have shown both.
